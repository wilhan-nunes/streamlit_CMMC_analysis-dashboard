     ## ðŸ”¬ Welcome to the CMMC Analysis Dashboard

     This interactive dashboard enables comprehensive analysis of **Collaborative Microbial Metabolite Center** enrichment workflow results combined with **Feature-Based Molecular Networking (FBMN)** data.

     ### **What This Tool Does**

     **Integrate Multiple GNPS2 workflow results:**
     - Combines CMMC enrichment results with FBMN quantification data
     - Merges metabolomics data with user-provided [sample metadata](#expected-metadata-table-format)
     - Creates merged tables and provides tools for comprehensive microbial metabolites analysis

     **Generate Interactive Visualizations:**
     - **Box Plots**: Compare metabolite abundances across different sample groups
     - **UpSet Plots**: Visualize overlaps and intersections in your data by metabolites source or origin
     - **Dynamic Filtering**: Explore data with flexible grouping and filtering options
     - **Advanced Network Visualization**: Visualize molecular networks with interactive features
     - **MicrobeMASST Search**: Search your spectra against a reference database of MS/MS data acquired from bacterial and fungal monocultures.

     ### **Getting Started**

     1. **Enter Task IDs**: Input your CMMC Enrichment and FBMN Task identifiers in the sidebar
     2. **Upload Metadata**: Provide your sample metadata table (CSV, Excel, TSV or TXT format)
     3. **Run Analysis**: Click the "ðŸš€ Run Analysis" button to fetch and process your data
     4. **Explore Results**: Use the interactive plots to investigate your metabolomics data

     ### **Analysis Features**

     **Overview Box Plot Analysis:**
     - Allows a broader overview of the data
     - Select each metadata attribute column and value to use as groups
     - Filter microbial metabolites by source or origin 
     - Select specific features for detailed examination
     - Download all features plots as a pdf file
     
     **Box Plot Analysis:**
     - Compare metabolite abundances between sample groups
     - Filter by metadata attributes
     - Select specific features for detailed examination
     - Visualize statistical distributions and outliers
     - Download all features plots as a pdf file

     **UpSet Plot Visualization:**
     - Understand data intersections and unique elements
     - Group by source or origin classifications
     - Identify patterns in metabolite presence across samples
     
     **Molecular Network** (Advanced Visualization)
     - Visualize chemical relationships between metabolites based on spectral similarity
     - Explore networks of structurally related compounds across samples
     - Identify potential novel compounds or analogs through network propagation
     
     **MicrobeMASST Taxonomic Tree** (Advanced Visualization)
     - Map microbial metabolite origins onto a taxonomic hierarchy
     - Explore metabolite detection at different taxonomic levels (e.g., genus, species)

     ### **Tips for Best Results**

     - [Ensure your metadata table contains sample identifiers that match your FBMN data](#expected-metadata-table-format)
     - Use descriptive column names in your metadata for clearer visualizations
     - Try different grouping combinations to uncover hidden patterns in your data
